# sqlctx

`sqlctx` or (SQLContext) is a tool for generating LLM context from database tables. It is targeted at data professionals as a force multiplier, codifying the process of providing table schema to LLMs inside of AI-enabled code editors.

Rather than existing as an editor extension, SQLContext outputs context about your database to a directory (`./sqlctx`) such that you can include them with any LLM-enabled editor by mentioning the file for that database table.

SQLContext pairs well with:

- Visual Studio Code
- Cursor
- Zed
- Windsurf

## Getting Started

Start by installing either `uv` or `pipx` to run python CLIs without installing to system packages.

### Configuration

SQLContext can be run on demand or configured. To configure for a given directory, run the following to generate a config file. You will need your database connection information handy.

```uvx sqlctx add```

A config file will be written to `.sqlctx/config.toml`. You can embed environment variables directly in the toml like `${ENV_VAR}` and they will be replaced if the variable has been set.

## Generating Context

You can generate context with the `uvx sqlctx generate` command. It will be written to the relative directory `./sqlctx`. It is recommended that you check this directory into your repository and _not_ gitignore, since your editor likely does not treat gitignored files the same as regular project files.

## Consuming Context

Since most AI editors allow mentioning files, SQLContext relies on this. When writing a new query, simply "mention" a table to include the schema and a few sample records in the context of your chat.

For example, if I'm writing a query calculting ARPU, I might choose to mention my `sessions` table and `revenue` table, since I know these are relevant.

1. Visual Studio Code - `CMD + /` from any copilot input to include any project file
2. Zed - `CMD + /` from the context pane to include any project file
3. Cursor — `@`-mention the relevant tables in chat, composer, or inline edit
4. Windsurf - `@`-mention the relevant table from the Cascade UI

Many editors also have a RAG-search that surfaces relevant files without explicit mention, but explicitly mentioning relevant tables tends to lead to the highest quality generations.
